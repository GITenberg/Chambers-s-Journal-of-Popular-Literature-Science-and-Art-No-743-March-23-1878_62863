</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Toby</span> was a sheep of middling size, lightly built,
finely limbed, as agile as a deer, with dark
intelligent gazelle-like eyes, and a small pair of
neatly curled horns, with the points protruding
about an inch from his forehead. His colour
was white except on the face, which was slightly
darker.</p>

<p>As an old sailor I wish to say something of
Toby’s history. I was on board the good brig
<i>Reliance</i> of Arbroath, bound from Cork to Galatz,
on the left bank of the Danube. All went well
with the little ship until she reached the Grecian
Archipelago, and here she was detained by adverse
winds and contrary currents, making the passage
through the islands both a dangerous and a difficult
one. When the mariners at length reached
Tenedos, it was found that the current from
the Dardanelles was running out like a mill-stream,
which made it impossible to proceed; and
accordingly the anchor was cast, the jolly-boat was
lowered, and the captain took the opportunity of
going on shore for fresh water, of which they
were scarce. Having filled his casks, it was only
natural for a sailor to long to treat himself to a
mess of fresh meat as well as water. He accordingly
strolled away through the little town; but
soon found that butchers were as yet unknown
in Tenedos. Presently, however, a man came up
with a sheep, which the captain at once purchased
for five shillings. This was Toby, with whom, his
casks of water, and a large basket of ripe fruit, the
skipper returned to his vessel. There happened
to be on board this ship a large and rather useless
half-bred Newfoundland. This dog was the very
first to receive the attentions of Master Toby, for
no sooner had he placed foot on the deck, than he
ran full tilt at the poor Newfoundland, hitting
him square on the ribs and banishing almost
every bit of breath from his body. ‘Only a sheep,’
thought the dog, and flew at Toby at once. But
Toby was too nimble to be caught, and he planted
his blows with such force and precision, that at last
the poor dog was fain to take to his heels, howling
with pain, and closely pursued by Toby. The dog
only escaped by getting out on to the bowsprit,
where of course Toby could not follow, but quietly
lay down in a safe place to wait and watch for
him.</p>

<p>This first adventure shewed that Toby was no
ordinary sheep. How he had been trained to
act an independent part no one could tell. His
education, certainly, had not been neglected. That
same evening the captain was strolling on the
quarter-deck eating a bunch of grapes, when Toby
came up to him, and standing on one end,
planted his fore-feet on his shoulders, and looked
into his face, as much as to say: ‘I’ll have some
of those, please.’</p>

<p>And he was not disappointed, for the captain
amicably went shares with Toby. Toby appeared
so grateful for even little favours, and so attached
to his new master, that Captain Brown had not
the heart to kill him. He would rather, he
thought, go without fresh meat all his life. So
Toby was installed as ship’s pet. Ill-fared it then
with the poor Newfoundland; he was so battered
and cowed, that for dear life’s sake he dared not
leave his kennel even to take his food. It was
determined, therefore, to put an end to the poor
fellow’s misery, and he was accordingly shot.
This may seem cruel, but it was kind in the
main.</p>

<p>Now there was on board the <i>Reliance</i> an old
Irish cook. One morning soon after the arrival of
Toby, Paddy, who had a round bald pate, be it
remembered, was bending down over a wooden
platter cleaning the vegetables for dinner, when
Toby took the liberty of insinuating his woolly
nose to help himself. The cook naturally enough
struck Toby on the snout with the flat of the
knife and went on with his work. Toby backed
astern at once; a blow he never could and never
did receive without taking vengeance. Besides, he
imagined, no doubt, that holding down his bald
head as he did, the cook was desirous of trying the
strength of their respective skulls. When he had
backed astern sufficiently for his purpose, Toby
gave a spring: the two heads came into violent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>{178}</span>
collision, and down rolled poor Paddy on the deck.
Then Toby coolly finished all the vegetables, and
walked off as if nothing had happened out of the
usual.</p>

<p>Toby’s hatred of the whole canine race was
invincible. One day when the captain and his pet
were taking their usual walk on the promenade,
there came on shore the skipper of a Falmouth
ship, accompanied by a very large formidable-looking
dog. And the dog only resembled his master,
as you observe dogs usually do. As soon as he
saw Toby he commenced to set his dog upon him;
but Toby had seen him coming and was quite <i>en
garde</i>; so a long and fierce battle ensued, in which
Toby was slightly wounded and the dog’s head
was severely cut. Quite a multitude had assembled
to witness the fight, and the ships’ riggings
were alive with sailors. At one time the brutal
owner of the dog, seeing his pet getting worsted,
attempted to assist him; but the crowd would have
pitched him neck and crop into the river, had he
not desisted. At last both dog and sheep were
exhausted, and drew off, as if by mutual consent.
The dog seated himself close to the outer edge of
the platform, which was about three feet higher
than the river’s bank, and Toby went, as he was
wont to do, and stood between his master’s legs,
resting his head fondly on the captain’s clasped
hands, but never took his eyes off the foe. Just
then a dog on board one of the ships happened to
bark, and the Falmouth dog looked round. This
was Toby’s chance, and he did not miss it or his
enemy either. He was upon him like a bolt from
a catapult. One furious blow knocked the dog off
the platform, next moment Toby had leaped on top
of him, and was chasing the yelling animal towards
his own ship. There is no doubt Toby would
have crossed the plank and followed him on board,
had not his feet slipped and precipitated him into
the river. A few minutes afterwards, when Toby,
dripping with wet, returned to the platform to
look for his master, he was greeted with ringing
cheers; and many was the piastre spent in treating
our woolly friend to fruit. Toby was the hero of
Galatz from that hour; but the Falmouth dog
never ventured on shore again, and his master as
seldom as possible.</p>

<p>On her downward voyage, when the vessel
reached Sulina, at the mouth of the river, it became
necessary to lighten her in order to get her
over the bar. This took some time, and Toby’s
master frequently had to go on shore; but Toby
himself was not permitted to accompany him, on
account of the filth and muddiness of the place.
When the captain wished to return he came down
to the river-side and hailed the ship to send a
boat. And poor Toby was always on the watch
for his master if no one else was. He used to
place his fore-feet on the bulwarks and bleat loudly
towards the shore, as much as to say: ‘I see you,
master, and you’ll have a boat in a brace of shakes.’
Then if no one was on deck, Toby would at once
proceed to rouse all hands fore and aft. If the
mate Mr Gilbert pretended to be asleep on a
locker, he would fairly roll him off on to the deck.</p>

<p>Toby was revengeful to a degree, and if any
one struck him, he would wait his chance, even if
for days, to pay him out with interest in his
own coin. He was at first very jealous of two
little pigs which were bought as companions to
him; but latterly he grew fond of them, and as
they soon got very fat, Toby used to roll them
along the deck like a couple of foot-balls. There
were two parties on board that Toby did not like,
or rather that he liked to annoy whenever he got
the chance, namely the cook and the cat. He
used to cheat the former and chase the latter on
every possible occasion. If his master took pussy
and sat down with him on his knee, Toby would
at once commence to strike it off with his head.
Finding that she was so soft and yielding that this
did not hurt her, he would then lift his fore-foot
and attempt to strike her down with that; failing
in that, he would bite viciously at her; and if the
captain laughed at him, then all Toby’s vengeance
would be wreaked on his master. But after a
little scene like this, the sheep would always
come and coax for forgiveness. Our hero was
taught a great many tricks, among others to
leap backward and forward through a life-buoy.
When his hay and fresh provisions went done,
Toby would eat pea-soup, invariably slobbering
all his face in so doing, and even pick a bone
like a dog. He was likewise very fond of boiled
rice, and his drink was water, although he preferred
porter and ale; but while allowing him a
reasonable quantity of beer, the captain never
encouraged him in the bad habit, the sailors
had taught him, of chewing tobacco.</p>

<p>It is supposed that some animals have a prescience
of coming storms. Toby used to go
regularly to the bulwarks every night, and placing
his feet against them snuff all around him. If content,
he would go and lie down and fall fast asleep;
but it was a sure sign of bad weather coming
before morning when Toby kept wandering by
his master’s side and would not go to rest.</p>

<p>One day Captain Brown was going up the steps
of the Custom-house, when he found that not only
Toby but Toby’s two pigs were following close at
his heels. He turned round to drive them all
back; but Toby never thought for a moment that
his master meant that <i>he</i> should return.</p>

<p>‘It is these two awkward creatures of pigs,’
thought Toby, ‘that master can’t bear the sight of.’</p>

<p>So Toby went to work at once, and first rolled
one piggie down-stairs, then went up and rolled
the other piggie down-stairs; but the one piggie
always got to the top of the stair again by the
time his brother piggie was rolled down to the
bottom. Thinking that as far as appearances went,
Toby had his work cut out for the next half-hour,
his master entered the Custom-house. But Toby
and his friends soon found some more congenial
employment; and when Captain Brown returned,
he found them all together in an outer room,
dancing about with the remains of a new mat
about their necks, which they had just succeeded
in tearing to pieces.</p>

<p>Their practical jokes cost the captain some
money one way or another.</p>

<p>One day the three friends made a combined
attack on a woman, who was carrying a young pig
in a sack; this little pig happened to squeak,
when Toby and his pigs went to the rescue. They
tore the woman’s dress to atoms and delivered
the little pig. Toby was very much addicted to
describing the arc of a circle; that was all very
good when it was merely a fence he was flying
over, but when it happened that a window was
in the centre of the arc, then it came rather hard
on the captain’s pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>{179}</span></p>

<p>In order to enable him to pick up a little after
his long voyage, Toby was sent to country lodgings
at a farmer’s. But barely a week had elapsed
when the farmer sent him back again with his
compliments, saying that he would not keep him
for his weight in gold. He led the farmer’s sheep
into all sorts of mischief that they had never
dreamed of before, and had defied the dogs, and
half-killed one or two of them.</p>

<p>Toby returned like himself, for when he saw
his master in the distance he bleated aloud for
joy, and flew towards him like a wild thing,
dragging the poor boy in the mud behind him.</p>

<p>Toby was taken on board a vessel which was
carrying out emigrants to New York, and was
constantly employed all day in driving the steerage
passengers off the quarter-deck. He never
hurt the children, however, but contented himself
by tumbling them along the deck and stealing
their bread and butter.</p>

<p>From New York Toby went to St Stephens.
There a dog flew out and bit Captain Brown in the
leg. It was a dear bite, however, for the dog, for
Toby caught it in the act and hardly left life
enough in it to crawl away. At St Stephens Toby
was shorn, the weather being oppressively hot.
No greater insult could have been offered him.
His anger and chagrin were quite ludicrous to witness.
He examined himself a dozen times, and
every time he looked round and saw his naked
back he tried to run away from himself. But
when his master, highly amused at his antics,
attempted to add insult to injury, by pointing his
finger at him and laughing him to scorn, Toby’s
wrath knew no bounds, and he attacked the
captain on the spot. He managed, however, to
elude the blow, and Toby walked on shore in a
pet. Whether it was that he was ashamed of his
ridiculous appearance, or of attempting to strike
his kind master in anger, cannot be known, but
for three days and nights Toby never appeared,
and the captain was very wretched indeed. But
when he did return, he was so exceedingly penitent
and so loving and coaxing that he was forgiven
on the spot.</p>

<p>When Toby arrived with his vessel in Queen’s
Dock, Liverpool, on a rainy morning, some nice
fresh hay was brought on board. This was a great
treat for our pet, and after he had eaten his fill, he
thought he could not do better than sleep among
it, which thought he immediately transmuted to
action, covering himself all up except the head.
By-and-by the owner of the ship came on board,
and taking a survey of things in general he spied
Toby’s head.</p>

<p>‘Hollo!’ he said, ‘what’s that?’ striking Toby’s
nose with his umbrella. ‘Stuffed, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>Stuffed or not stuffed, there was a body behind
it—as the owner soon knew to his cost—and
a spirit that never brooked a blow, for next
moment he found himself lying on his back with
his legs waggling in the air in the most expressive
manner, while Toby stood triumphantly over him
waiting to repeat the dose if required.</p>

<p>The following anecdote shews Toby’s reasoning
powers. He was standing one day near the dockyard
foreman’s house, when the dinner bell rang,
and just at the same time a servant came out with
a piece of bread for Toby. Every day after this,
as soon as the same bell rang—‘That calls me,’
said Toby to himself, and off he would trot to
the foreman’s door. If the door was not at once
opened he used to knock with his head; and he
would knock and knock again until the servant,
for peace-sake, presented him with a slice of bread.</p>

<p>And now Toby’s tale draws near its close.
The owner never forgave that blow, and one day
coming by chance across the following entry in
the ship’s books, ‘Tenedos—to one sheep, 5s.,’ he
immediately claimed Toby as his rightful property.
It was all in vain that the captain begged hard for
his poor pet, and even offered ten times his
nominal value for him. The owner was deaf to all
entreaties and obdurate. So the two friends were
parted. Toby was sent a long way into the country
to Carnoustie, in Forfarshire, to amuse some of the
owner’s children, who were at school there. But
the sequel shews how very deeply and dearly
even a sheep can love a kind-hearted master.
After the captain left him, poor Toby refused all
food and <i>died of grief in one week’s time</i>.</p>

<p>‘I have had many pets,’ says Captain Brown,
‘but only one Toby.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.—LIFTS A CORNER OF THE MASK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth Willis</span> bending forward, her gloved fingers
clasped upon the open letter that she held, and
her pale face on fire, as it were, with eager
passion, seemed sadly out of tune with the still
beauty of that silvan spot, where first the crystal
Start, freed from its moorland cradle, gushed forth
as a real river, although of puny dimensions, bearing
its watery tribute to the sea. Above, arched
the feathery larch, the slender hazel, and the
tapering ash. Branches of the mountain-ash projected
like the stone frettings of some medieval
belfrey. The clear sweet warble of mavis and
merle came throbbing softly to the ear from the
dim green heart of the summer woodlands. The
letter which she had purloined—the theft may
have been prompted by the impulse of the
moment, and it is charitable to hope that such
deeds were new to her—was now hers, to peruse
at her leisure. She read it then, did Ruth Willis,
again and again, slowly and deliberately, scanning
and weighing every word, as though she had been
a student of the cuneiform character, puzzling out
Babylonian tablets by the aid of vague and tentative
keys to the long-dead language of which they
bore the impress.</p>

<p>The letter ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap mr4">8 Bond’s Chambers,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">St Nicholas Poultney, London.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir Sykes</span>—It might be as well perhaps
that we should come to an understanding at once
respecting the business on which I spoke to you
at the <i>De Vere Arms</i> some days since. I do
not know whether you are aware that I hold
evidence substantiating the entire circumstances
of the case, which I could at any time reveal.
I will mention no names of place or person,
since this is unwelcome to you; but in return
for my consideration for your interests, and for
those whose prosperity and good name are <i>now</i>
knit up in yours, I consider myself to possess
a claim upon your confidence. I therefore permit
myself to think that as your legal adviser I
could conduct your affairs so that you should be
under no apprehension for the future, provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>{180}</span>
always that the entire management (professionally)
of your estate and property should be placed in
my hands. This, after due consideration, I think
would be the most expedient manner of settling
matters for the advantage of all parties concerned.</p>

<p>Trusting that you may see this arrangement in
the same light as myself, and that it may meet
with your approval, as the only means of arriving
at a definitive understanding, I shall await your
reply. I beg to remain, my dear sir, very obediently
and faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Enoch Wilkins</span>, <i>Solicitor</i>.
</p></div>

<p>Such was the letter which Sir Sykes Denzil had
unguardedly left upon his library table; and it
may be admitted that a more impudent epistle has
rarely been addressed to a gentleman of equal
station to that of the proprietor of Carbery. It
was difficult at first sight to believe that a demand
so audacious in itself, and so offensively urged,
could be intended as anything else than a sorry
jest. Yet that the writer was quite in earnest,
nay more, that he felt himself assured of not
craving in vain for the coveted boon, was palpable
to so attentive a critic as was Ruth Willis.</p>

<p>‘If any man had dared to write thus to me,’ she
said, slowly hissing out the words between her
half-shut teeth, ‘and I had filled the position held
by yonder pompous dolt, I would have—ay, given
him cause to repent it.’</p>

<p>And the lurid light that glimmered in her dark
eyes, and the hardening of her shrewd pale face
until it seemed as though of chiselled marble
rather than sentient flesh, and the swift and sudden
gesture with which she raised and shook her
clenched hand, as though it held a dagger—these
signs were the revelation of a fierce and unscrupulous
nature, kept down by the pressure of circumstances,
but ready at pinch of need to flame forth,
as the hot lava bubbles and seethes beneath the
crust of cold ashes in which the vines of the
Italian peasant have struck root.</p>

<p>Again and with deliberate care did the baronet’s
ward read the letter through. Then she refolded
it and replaced it in her pocket, and then consulted
her watch. Only a few minutes had as
yet elapsed since her escape—for it was little else—from
the mansion.</p>

<p>‘I must not go back as yet,’ she said thoughtfully.
‘By this time the whole household will
be astir like a hive of angry bees, if, as is all
but certain, Sir Sykes has not had self-control
enough to keep his own counsel as to the loss
he has sustained. He should have burned this
choice epistle the moment he had made himself
master of its purport; but he is of that order
of men who treasure up the very proofs that
sooner or later overwhelm them with a weight
of silent evidence. Was it not the learned forger,
silver-tongued, plausible Dr Dodd, who was left
alone with the fatal document that brought him
to the gallows, alone in a room where a brisk
fire was blazing? One flash of mother-wit, one
motion of the hand, and nothing but a heap of
tinder would have remained to bear witness of
the fraud. But no! The doomed wretch waited
passive for the hangman’s fingers to adjust the
hempen noose about his miserable neck. So would
not I!’</p>

<p>Again the girl glanced impatiently at her watch.</p>

<p>‘How Time lags!’ she exclaimed petulantly,
as she marked the slow crawling of the thin black
minute-hand around the dial; ‘heeding nothing,
influenced by nothing, inexorable in his measured
pace. It is a pain to such as I am to be forced
to loiter here inactive, when there is a foe to
cope with, a peril to avert.’</p>

<p>She said no more, but paced restlessly to and
fro along the river-bank, beneath the arching
boughs, with somewhat of the air and tread of
a caged panther wearing away the sullen hours
of captivity behind the restraining bars. Her
very step had in it somewhat of the litheness
which we notice in the movements of the savage,
and the working of her keen features told how
deeply her busy brain was pondering on the
events of the day. Ruth’s face, when once it
was withdrawn from the observation of others,
was a singularly expressive one. When she had
left the room wherein Jasper had fallen asleep
among his pillows, the countenance of Sir Sykes’s
ward had been eloquent with weariness and contempt.
Now it told of resentment restrained,
but only in part restrained, by a caution that was
rather of habit than of instinct.</p>

<p>‘An hour more! yet an hour,’ said the girl
at length, again looking at her watch, and then
she stood leaning against the tough stem of a
quivering mountain-ash that almost overhung the
brawling torrent. She still kept in her left hand
the book which she had had with her when
entering the library at Carbery; but even had not
the volume been one which she had lately perused,
she was in no mood for reading. Manifestly her
mind was shaping out some desperate resolution.</p>

<p>‘I will do it!’ she said at last, lifting her head
with a defiant glitter in her lustrous eyes; ‘before
I sleep it shall be written. I know and gauge
beforehand the risk of such a course; know too
that I am loosening my own grasp on the helm if
I invite another to aid me. But that is better
than to be foiled at the outset, and after weeks
spent in this self-schooling, and in the sickening
task of cajoling a shallow, knavish egotist, such as
the future Sir Jasper will be until his dying day.
Let those look to it who for their own schemes
venture to cross my path!’</p>

<p>The hour, however slowly it might appear to
pass in the estimation of one whose nerves were
on fire with excitement, nevertheless did wear
itself out, and there was an end of waiting.
With tranquil step and unruffled brow, Sir Sykes’s
ward returned to her guardian’s house, to find, as
she had anticipated, confusion and dismay prevalent
there; the servants sullen or clamorous, the
baronet’s daughters distressed, and Sir Sykes himself
in a state of feverish suspicion, which almost
made him forget the traditions of good-breeding.</p>

<p>‘Do you, Miss Willis, know anything of this?’
he asked half rudely, the instant that he caught
sight of his ward.</p>

<p>‘I—know of what?’ returned Ruth innocently,
as she lifted her eyes, with a startled look, to his.</p>

<p>‘You forget, papa,’ said Lucy Denzil, almost
indignantly, ‘that Ruth has heard of nothing.
She was away from the house all the time.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; I beg pardon of course,’ exclaimed
the baronet reddening, but still fixing his eyes
searchingly on the placid face of his ward.</p>

<p>The Indian orphan bore his scrutiny with an
admirable composure. Her lower lip trembled a
little, as was natural, when she turned towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>{181}</span>
Lucy. ‘Pray do tell me,’ she said, ‘what has
happened? for it really does seem as though I
had been unfortunate enough to make Sir Sykes
angry with me.’</p>

<p>‘Papa has lost a letter—a letter of importance,’
said Lucy, blushing as she spoke; ‘and as the
servants deny all knowledge of it, and its loss’——</p>

<p>‘Say theft, not loss!’ interrupted the baronet
with unwonted harshness. ‘I make no doubt that
the letter was stolen from my desk in the library,
on which I had left it for but some two minutes,
while I went to speak with my son in the White
Room. The French window nearest to the fireplace
was open, giving an easy means of entry, as
of egress, for the purloiner of this letter, who
must have been on the watch for an opportunity
of surprising my secrets—that is to say,’ stammered
Sir Sykes, who felt the imprudence of
these last words—‘of basely prying into my
private correspondence.’</p>

<p>‘Are you quite, quite sure, papa dear,’ pleaded
Blanche, ‘that you left the letter there, instead of
bestowing it in some safe place for safe keeping,
which may afterwards have escaped your memory,
and will presently be recollected? Such things
have happened often and often, even to the most
methodical, and’——</p>

<p>‘There, there, my girl!’ broke in the baronet
peevishly. ‘Have I not heard that argument
repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by every man and maid
that I have questioned; and is it not the stock
answer to all inquiries after missing trinkets or
valuables unaccounted for? I grant that I can
prove nothing. If I could’——</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence, but crushing
down the wrath that almost choked his voice,
turned away. Nothing, at this unpleasant conjuncture,
could be in better taste, or more simple,
than Ruth’s demeanour. She began to cry. It
was the first time since the day of her arrival
that any one at Carbery had seen her in tears, and
now both Blanche and Lucy came kindly to kiss
her and console her with whispered entreaties to
excuse Sir Sykes for an indiscriminate anger
which there was much to palliate. But Ruth soon
dried her eyes, and going up to her guardian laid
her hand upon his arm and looked up timidly in
his face.</p>

<p>‘Let me be useful,’ she said. ‘Let me help in
hunting high and low for this letter; pray, pray
do, dear Sir Sykes, you who have been so very,
very kind to me since I have been here.’</p>

<p>Nothing could be prettier. And Sir Sykes,
though in his present irritable condition he actually
shuddered at her light touch upon his arm,
as though he had been in contact with a snake,
was compelled to say a word or two of apology.</p>

<p>‘I am greatly annoyed,’ he said awkwardly,
‘and have been unjust and inhospitable, I fear,
and must ask you to forget my rudeness. I am
best alone.’</p>

<p>Sir Sykes therefore withdrew, and for some
time was seen no more; while Jasper, who had
been an amused spectator of the turmoil, sauntered
back to the White Room, muttering as he went:
‘Lucky, rather, that this child had so perfect an
alibi, or the governor would have tried, convicted,
and sentenced his only son and heir as the light-fingered
captor of his lost property. A new sensation,
it strikes me, that of injured innocence.
And talking of that—how nicely Miss Ruth, be
she who she may, played her part—not one bit
overdone—it was perfect! We breathe here an
atmosphere of mystery; but it will be strange if,
when I am all right again, I do not make a push
to get at the governor’s secret, whatever it may
be.’</p>

<p>The letter, it need hardly be said, remained
undiscovered by the volunteer searchers who
undertook the quest of it; but gradually the
indignant household became more calm, and the
general voice confirmed the comfortable opinion,
that Sir Sykes had unwittingly locked up the
missing document in some desk or drawer, whence
it would one day be satisfactorily extracted.</p>

CHARACTER.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> can be little doubt that the domain of
mental science is being invaded on more than one
side by the sciences which deal more especially
with the material world and with the physical
universe around us. When physiologists discovered
that the force or impulse which travels along a
nerve, which originates in the brain, and which
represents the transformation of thought into
action, is nearly allied to the electrical force—now
one of man’s most useful and obedient ministers—one
avenue to the domain of mind was opened up.
And when physiologists, through the aid of delicate
apparatus, were actually enabled to measure
the rate at which this nerve-force travels along the
nerve-fibres, it may again be said that physical
science was encroaching on the domain of mind,
being in a certain sense thus enabled to measure
the rapidity of thought.</p>

<p>A study, exemplifying in a more than ordinary
degree the application of the methods of physical
science to the explanation of states of mind,
was brought under the notice of the members
of the British Association at the last meeting of
that body. In the department of Anthropology,
or the science investigating the physical and
mental constitution of the races of man, Mr
Francis Galton, as president of this section,
devoted his address to an exposition of the
classification or arrangement of groups of men,
according to their habits of mind, and their
physiognomy.</p>

<p>Of the curious and absorbing nature of such a
study nothing need be said. Lavater’s method
of pursuing the study of character through the
investigation of the features of the human face
has long been known. But Lavater’s system is on
the whole much too loose and elementary to be
regarded as satisfactory by modern scientists,
whose repudiation of phrenology as a system
capable of explaining the exact disposition of
the brain functions, has unquestionably affected
Lavater’s method also. Mr Galton refers at
the outset of his address to the fact we have
already alluded to—namely, that physiologists have
determined the rate at which nerve-force, representing
a sensation or impulse of thought and
action, travels along the nerves. The common
phrase ‘as quick as thought’ is found to be by
no means so applicable as is generally supposed,
especially when it is discovered that thought or
nervous impulse, as compared with light or
electricity, appears as a veritable laggard. For
whilst light travels at the rate of many thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>{182}</span>sands
of miles—about one hundred and eighty-six
thousand miles according to the latest researches—in
a second of time, nerve-force in man passes
along his nerves at a rate varying from one hundred
and ten or one hundred and twenty to two
hundred feet per second. Or, to use Mr Galton’s
words, nerve-force is ‘far from instantaneous’ in
its action, and has ‘indeed no higher velocity than
that of a railway express train.’</p>

<p>As we could naturally suppose from a consideration
of this fact, small animals presenting us with
a limited distance for nerve-force to travel, will
avoid rapid blows and shift for themselves in the
struggle for existence at a much quicker rate than
large animals. Take two extreme cases in illustration
of this fact. A mouse hears a suspicious or
threatening sound, and at once, so to speak, accommodates
its actions and movements to its protection.
The ear of the mouse, as one of its
‘gateways of knowledge,’ is situated so close to the
brain that the interval which elapses between the
reception of the sound by the ear, or between its
transmission as an impulse to the brain and the
issue of a command or second impulse from the
brain to the muscles of the body for the purpose of
movement, is too short to be perfectly appreciated
by the observer. In a whale, on the contrary,
which may attain a length of eighty feet, a much
longer interval will elapse before action of body
follows on nervous impulse, seeing that the
nerve-impulse has a longer distance to travel.
Assuming that in such animals as the whales the
nerve-action travels at the rate of seventy or
eighty feet per second, it follows that in a
large whale which has been struck near the tail by
a harpoon, a second or so will elapse before the
impulse is transmitted to the brain, whilst another
second will pass before the second impulse is
sent from the brain to put the muscles of the
tail in action for the purpose of retaliating upon
the harpooner. In such a case it is assumed that
the brain of the animal will be the nervous centre
or station at which information is received, and
from which instructions are in turn telegraphed to
the various organs and parts of the body. In the
actual details of the case, however, it is probable
that the spinal marrow of the animal or some part
of it would act as the ‘head-office’ for receiving and
issuing commands. We know that a headless frog
will wipe off with one foot a drop of vinegar that
has been placed on the other, and in the absence
of the brain we thus assume that the spinal
cord may act as a nerve-centre.</p>

<p>Doubtless the spinal marrow discharges this
function naturally; and in view of this latter
supposition, the interval between the reception of
a blow and the muscular actions of an animal
would be of less duration than in the case we have
just supposed, where the brain is regarded as the
central station of the nervous system. As an eminent
authority in physical science has remarked,
‘the interval required for the kindling of consciousness
would probably more than suffice for
the destruction of the brain by lightning, or even
by a rifle-bullet. Before the organ (that is, the
brain) can arrange itself, it may therefore be
destroyed, and in such a case we may safely conclude
that death is painless.’</p>

<p>But confining ourselves to the domain of human
thought, it seems perfectly clear that the differences
between persons of different temperament are
in reality referable in great part to the varying rates
at which nervous impulses are transmitted through
the nerves, and to or from the brain. The difference
between a person of phlegmatic disposition
and a person of sanguine temperament, may thus
be properly enough referred to the varying rates
with which sensations and feelings are appreciated
and acted upon. Disposition or temperament thus
becomes referred, secondarily, to the manner in
which and aptitude with which nerves receive and
transmit impressions. Primarily, of course, we
must refer the exact causes of the quicker or
slower transmission of impulses to the constitution
of the individual who exhibits them.</p>

<p>Mr Galton gives a very interesting example
of the differences to be observed between various
individuals in the respects just noted, by a reference
to a practice common amongst astronomers.
He says: ‘It is a well-known fact that different
observers make different estimates of the exact
moment of the occurrence of any event. There
is,’ he continues, ‘a common astronomical observation
in which the moment has to be recorded
at which a star that is travelling athwart the field
of view of a fixed telescope, crosses the fine
vertical wire by which that field of view is intersected.
In making this observation it is found
that some observers are over-sanguine and anticipate
the event, whilst others are sluggish, and
allow the event to pass by before they succeed
in noting it.’ This tendency of each individual
is clearly not the result either of inexperience or
carelessness, since, as astronomers well know, ‘it
is a persistent characteristic of each individual,
however practised in the art of making observations
or however attentive he may be.’ And so
accustomed indeed are astronomers to these differences
in observers, that a definite and standing
phrase—that of the ‘personal equation’—is used
in that science to express the difference between
the time of a man’s noting the event and that
of its actual occurrence. Every assistant in an
observatory has his ‘personal equation’ duly
ascertained, and has this correction applied to
each of his observations. This most interesting
fact relates exact or mathematical science in the
most curious manner to the mental character of
an individual. Mr Galton, however, does not
rest merely with the announcement of this latter
result. He goes much further in his theoretical
inquiry, and suggests that peculiarities in the
respect just noted might be found to be related
to special points in the conformation of the body.
Thus could the ‘personal equations’ of astronomers
be related to the height of body, age, colour of
hair and eyes, weight, and temperament, some
valuable facts might be deduced regarding the
union of definite characters to form a special
constitution.</p>

<p>Some other methods may be cited of estimating
the differences between various temperaments in
appreciating sensations and in acting upon them.
If a person is prepared to give an instantaneous
opinion as to the colour of a certain signal—black
or white—but is unaware of the particular colour
which is to be exhibited, and if he is further
instructed to press a stop with his right hand
for the one colour and a left-hand stop for the
other, the act of judgment necessary to determine
the particular stop in each instance, is found to
occupy an appreciable interval. This is particularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>{183}</span>
the case if a single signal has been previously
shewn, and the observer’s quickness of
sight has been tested and calculated by his pressing
a single stop whenever he saw the object.
The comparison between the interval elapsing
between the mere sensation of sight and the act
of pressing the stop in the latter case, and the
interval which elapses when the observer has to
make up his mind as to the difference between
two signals, is seen to be very marked.</p>

<p>Setting thus before his mind a certain number
of tests of individual temperament and character
such as have been illustrated, the observer may
next proceed to the task of discovering whether
persons who exhibit similar qualities of mind in
these experiments, can be proved to be related to
each other in other particulars of their physical
or mental disposition. Mr Galton has ingeniously
suggested that by an arrangement of mirrors, four
views of a person’s head might be taken at once,
and would thus afford an ordinary photographic
portrait, a portrait of a three-quarter face, a
profile view, and a figure of the top of the head
respectively. Such a series of views would present
all the aspects required for a comparison of the
general as well as special contour of the head of
the individual with the heads of others photographed
in like manner.</p>

<p>Our author, whose researches on the heredity
of men of genius and the transmission from one
generation to another of qualities belonging to the
highest development of man’s estate, are well
known, turned his attention to the opposite phase
of human life and character, and investigated in
an avowedly casual, but still important manner,
the likenesses and differences between members
of the criminal classes of England. The social and
practical importance of a study such as the present
may be readily estimated. There are few persons
who have not considered the bearings and influence
of criminal antecedents upon the offenders of the
present day. Although to a very large extent our
temperaments and dispositions are of our own
making, and are susceptible of the favouring
influences of education and moral training, there
can be no doubt of the truth of the converse
remark, that to a very great extent the traits of
character we inherit from our parents exercise an
undeniable influence over us for weal or for woe.
If, therefore, through research in the direction we
have indicated, it can be shewn that criminality
runs in types, our notions of criminal responsibility,
and our ideas regarding the punishment,
deterrent and otherwise, of the criminal classes,
must be affected and ameliorated thereby.</p>

<p>That criminality, like moral greatness, ‘runs in
the blood,’ there can be no doubt. It would in
fact be a most unwonted violation of the commonest
law of nature, were we to find the children
of criminals free from the moral taints of their
parents. As physical disease is transmissible, and
as the conditions regulating its descent are now
tolerably well ascertained, so moral infirmities
pass from one generation to another, and the ‘law
of likeness’ is thus seen to hold true of mind as
well as of body. Numerous instances might be
cited of the transmission of criminal traits of character,
often of very marked and special kind. Dr
Despine, a continental writer, gives one very
remarkable case illustrating the transmission from
one generation to another of an extraordinary
tendency to thieve and steal. The subjects of the
memoir in question were a family named Chrétien,
of which the common ancestor, so to speak, Jean
Chrétien by name, had three sons, Pierre, Thomas,
and Jean-Baptiste. Pierre in his turn had one
son, who was sentenced to penal servitude for life
for robbery and murder. Thomas had two sons,
one of whom was condemned to a like sentence
for murder; the other being sentenced to death
for a like crime. Of the children of Jean-Baptiste,
one son (Jean-François) married one Marie Tauré,
who came of a family noted for their tendency to
the crime of incendiarism. Seven children were
born to this couple with avowedly criminal antecedents
on both sides. Of these, one son, Jean-François,
named after his father, died in prison
after undergoing various sentences for robberies.
Another son, Benoist, was killed by falling off a
house-roof which he had scaled in the act of theft;
and a third son, ‘Clain’ by nickname, after being
convicted of several robberies, died at the age of
twenty-five. Victor, a fourth son, was also a
criminal; Marie-Reine, a daughter, died in prison—as
also did her sister Marie-Rose—whither both
had been sent for theft. The remaining daughter
Victorine, married a man named Lemarre, the son
of this couple being sentenced to death for robbery
and murder.</p>

<p>This hideous and sad record of whole generations
being impelled, as it were, hereditarily to
crime, is paralleled by the case of the notorious
Jukes-family, whose doings are still matters of
comment amongst the legal and police authorities
of New York. A long and carefully compiled
pedigree of this family shews the sad but striking
fact, that in the course of seven generations no
fewer than five hundred and forty individuals of
Jukes blood were included amongst the criminal
and pauper classes. The account appears in the
Thirty-first Annual Report of the Prison Association
of New York (1876); and the results of an
investigation into the history of the fifth generation
alone, may be shortly referred to in the present
instance as presenting us with a companion
case to that of the somewhat inaptly named Chrétien
family. This fifth generation of the Jukes
tribe sprang from the eldest of the five daughters
of the common ancestor of the race. One
hundred and three individuals are included
in this generation; thirty-eight of these coming
through an illegitimate grand-daughter, and
eighty-five through legitimate grand-children.
The great majority of the females consorted with
criminals: sixteen of the thirty-eight have been
convicted—one nine times—some of heinous
crimes: eleven are paupers and led dissolute or
criminal lives: four were inveterate drunkards:
the history of three is unknown; and a small
minority of four are known to have lived respectable
and honest lives. Of the eighty-five legitimate
descendants, only five were incorrigible
criminals, and only some thirteen were paupers
or dissolute. Jukes himself, the founder of this
prolific criminal community, was born about 1730,
and is described as a curious unsteady man of
gipsy descent, but apparently without deliberately
bad or intently vicious instincts. Through unfavourable
marriages, the undecided character of
the father ripened into the criminal traits of his
descendants. The moral surroundings being of
the worst description, the beginnings of criminality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>{184}</span>
became intensified, and hence arose naturally, and
as time passed, the graver symptoms of diseased
morality and criminal disposition.</p>

<p>The data upon which a true classification of
criminals may be founded are as yet few and
imperfect, but Mr Galton mentions it as a hopeful
fact, that physiognomy and the general contour
of the head can be shewn to afford valuable evidence
of the grouping of criminals into classes.
This method of investigation, however, it must be
noted, is by no means a return to the old standing
of phrenology, which, as all readers know, boasts
its ability to mark out the surface of the brain
itself into a large number of different faculties.
The most that anthropologists would contend for,
according to the data laid down, is, that certain
general types of head and face are peculiar to
certain types of criminals. Physical conformation
of a general kind becomes thus in a general
manner related to the mental type.</p>

<p>The practical outcome of such a subject may
be readily found in the ultimate attention which
morality, education, and the state itself, may give
to the reclaiming of youthful criminals and to the
fostering, from an early period in their history, of
those tendencies of good which even the most
degraded may be shewn to possess. If it be true
that we are largely the products of past time, and
that our physical and mental constitutions are in
great measure woven for us and independently of
us, it is none the less a stable fact, that there
exists a margin of free-will, which, however
limited in extent, may be made in the criminal
and debased, and under proper training and
encouragement, the foundation of a new and
better life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.—TO-DAY—TROUBLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> came and passed away without anything
happening to break the even tenor of existence.
Spring came, and with spring the appearance of
a new novel of Mr Collingwood Dawson. Having
had a considerable share in its manufacture, I felt
naturally anxious to know the result of its appearance.
I had an encouraging note from Mrs Collingwood
Dawson: ‘Much liked—goes off very
well:’ and I saw from the advertisements in the
papers that the notices of the press were generally
favourable. At the head of them all was the
following extract from the <i>Hebdomadal Review</i>:
‘High capacity—very good—many readers—enticing
interest.’ Tributes of appreciation that were
valuable from a periodical rarely given to praise
overmuch any one unconnected with the house it
represents.</p>

<p>Soon after I had another note from my employer:
‘I am coming over to confer with you on
literary and other matters; please make all necessary
arrangements. I shall be accompanied by a
female friend, but not, alas, by Mr Collingwood
Dawson!’</p>

<p>The steamer that plies the Lower Seine in the
summer months, came puffing up the river one
fine breezy morning, and dropped into a little
boat that put off to meet her, two female passengers,
a quantity of boxes, and a little white dog.
I recognised my expected visitors, and hastened
down to the landing-place to meet them. I explained
that my house was not big enough to take
them in; but that I had secured rooms at the
hotel close by, and that my wife and I hoped to
have as much of their society as they could give
us.</p>

<p>After they had settled down in their new abode,
Mrs Collingwood Dawson came over to see me,
and was shewn into the pavilion.</p>

<p>‘I am in a good deal of doubt and difficulty,’
she said; ‘and I have come to ask your opinion
and discuss matters with you. But as it is no use
putting half-confidence in you, and your opinion
will be of little good unless you know fully all
the circumstances of the case, I mean to tell you
everything; and will first begin, if you please, and
if it does not bore you too much, with a little
sketch of my life.’</p>

<p>I assured her that I should have great pleasure
in listening to her, as anything connected with her
was of interest to me.</p>

<p>‘I am,’ she began, ‘the daughter of an official
of the old India House; and my father, who had
held a good position there, and enjoyed a good
income, left at his death no other provision for his
widow and only child, myself, but the pensions
to which we were entitled—a very handsome one
indeed for my mother; and for myself some seventy
pounds a year, which ceased at my marriage. He
had been during his lifetime very fond of good
society, especially literary society; and thus from
early years I had been acquainted with many people
who followed that profession. Consequently it is
not surprising that I tried to add to an income
sufficiently narrow by literary work, although I
confess that I had no particular talent, and certainly
no enthusiasm for the task, and met with
little success. In this way I became acquainted
with several publishers and many authors; among
others was my first husband. He was a man of
great intellectual power and force of will, but
quite without any ballast of judgment or common-sense.
Still I was very much enthralled by his
influence, and he having formed a violent passion
for me, insisted on marrying me. Young and ill-advised,
I gave way to his impetuosity, and married
we were. I soon had cause to repent the hasty
step. He had been a man of most irregular habits;
and after a brief period of devotion to me, he
resumed them. Our household became a scene
of constant jars and quarrels; he wearied out my
life, and I must have wearied out his. The beautiful
soul that I thought I had recognised as
enshrined in his somewhat ill-formed and stunted
figure, had no existence for me. He was malignant
and detestable, utterly—most utterly.’</p>

<p>Her voice trembled with anger at the retrospect,
whilst her eyes filled with indignant tears.</p>

<p>‘It was an ill-assorted match evidently,’ I said.
‘But why did you not agree to separate?’</p>

<p>‘I shrank from mentioning such a thing; with
all his faults, I believed that he was still at the
bottom devotedly attached to me. Besides, such
a step is always distressing and compromising.
No; I went on bearing my troubles, not silently
indeed, for I have too much spirit, I confess, to
make a meek and uncomplaining wife; but I bore
them anyhow, although I confess that any affection
I ever had for him had been lost in the embroilments
of our married life. You may think that
I was to blame, and that if there were a real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>{185}</span>
attachment on his part towards me, I ought to
have been able to manage him; but I tell you no!
There was a certain malignity in his nature that
made him spiteful and tormenting even to those
whom he loved. Anyhow, life was a sorrowful
burden to me whilst he was with me.’</p>

<p>She rose, looking quite overcome by the recital
of her troubles. Her eyes were filled with tears;
her hands trembled nervously, as she raised them
to press the hair back from her forehead. I murmured
a few words expressive of sympathy and
good-will.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ she said, sitting down and wiping her
eyes with a pretty embroidered handkerchief; ‘not
to dwell upon my troubles. I was at last relieved
from the hateful knot by his death—a death I
believe he contrived in a way that should leave
me in as cruel and doubtful a position as possible.
He left home one day without giving me any
intimation that he would stay away—that was his
general practice—or leaving me any money to carry
on the household expenses. And the next thing I
heard of him was from a little village on the coast,
that he had been drowned while bathing. I
believe that he committed suicide. I ascertained
that he had been informing himself most minutely
of the set of the tides and currents about the coast,
and with fiendish ingenuity had taken to the
water at a time when the tide was certain to carry
his body far out to sea.’</p>

<p>‘But what object could he have had in that,
madam?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you see? The pension which I had lost
in marrying revived on my widowhood. But he
had contrived that his body should never be found.
In vain I applied to the authorities to renew my
pension. There had been several cases of attempted
personation and fraud about these pensions, and
they utterly refused to renew mine without absolute
proof of my husband’s death. This I was
unable to afford to their satisfaction, his body never
having been discovered. Still the circumstantial
evidence was most strong, and I was advised to
bring an action in the way of a petition of right.
A circumstance, however, occurred,’ said the widow
with a slight blush, ‘which rendered such a step
unnecessary.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I see,’ I cried; ‘you married again?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and this time my venture was more
fortunate. My second husband was an officer in
the army, frank and free and brave. No young
couple could have been happier. But alas! we
were neither of us prudent in the management of
our affairs. We had small means in the present,
but great expectations, and we were too sanguine
to think of the possibility of disappointment. Life
became a series of feasts and fêtes. My husband
sold out of the army, and we lived gaily enough on
the proceeds of his commission, till that was all
gone, and we saw ourselves brought to the verge of
ruin. I must tell you that my husband was also
of a literary turn, and wrote military sketches and
so on, that brought in a little money, but nothing
substantial.</p>

<p>‘We had one resource still left—the house in
which we lived; it had been my mother’s, and at
her death she left it to me. It was a pretty little
house in the neighbourhood of St John’s Wood;
but it was leasehold only, and the lease had not
more than ten years to run. We had found it
under these circumstances impossible to mortgage
our interest. We might have sold the lease; and
that with the furniture, which had also been my
mother’s, would have realised five or six hundred
pounds. But when that was gone, where should
we look for shelter? Charles’s great expectations’——</p>

<p>‘Pardon me for interrupting you. You have
mentioned your husband’s Christian name: it will
make your narrative clearer if you tell me also his
surname.’</p>

<p>‘Collingwood was his name—Charles Collingwood.’</p>

<p>‘And the name of the first one was Dawson?’</p>

<p>‘You have guessed rightly. To continue. Charles’s
great expectations had all come to a bad end. A
rich relative, who had brought him up for his heir,
took a great dislike to me, and cut him out of his
will, for no reason in the world but that he had
married me, and that we were very poor. When
he died, and we found this out, it seemed that the
world had come to an end for us. What was to be
done? Live in the most niggardly way we might,
but we could not live on nothing. First we began to
sell the less essential parts of our belongings. We
lived on old china for three months; and then we
began on our paintings. We had some good ones
by English artists, which my father had left behind
him, and these kept us for a while. But this was
like burning the planks of the ship to keep the
engines going. Charles had tried hard for employment
in the meantime. For the governorship of a
colony; for a consulship; the post of adjutant of
militia; the same thing in a Volunteer regiment;
for the chief-constableship of a large town; for the
management of a brewery; and ever so many things
besides. All of no use.</p>

<p>“We must take in washing,” said Charles; “and
I will become a second Mantilini, and turn the
mangle.”</p>

<p>‘Lodgers were our next thought, and that seemed
more feasible. Then some one advised us to let our
house furnished. We put an advertisement in the
papers, and by great good luck we had an offer for
the whole of the house at once. Six guineas a
week for May, June, and July. We made up our
minds to take cheap lodgings somewhere on the
coast, and spend only half our weekly six guineas,
which would thus last us six months instead of
three. As we were packing up our belongings
and storing away the packages in the lumber-room,
Charles stumbled over a lot of old boxes, from
which arose a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“What are these old things?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about them. They
were my first husband’s books and papers.”</p>

<p>“Books, eh?” said Charles. “Let’s have a look at
’em;” and broke open one of the boxes. This, however,
turned out to be full of packets of manuscripts.
Charles made a wry face over them, but
he took out a packet and began to read it. I went
on with the work. I had everything to do then, I
must tell you, for we had dismissed our servants,
and lived in the house by ourselves with only a
char-woman to help—quite in picnic style.</p>

<p>‘Well dinner-time came, and Charles, who was
still up-stairs reading his manuscript, brought it
down with him and laid it beside his plate, and
went on again reading directly after dinner.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, old woman,” he said,
as we went to bed, “I feel muddled with it all,
and rather as if I’d been supping off pork chops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>{186}</span>
and Welsh-rabbit; but there’s something in that
fellow’s writings, only they are coarse, decidedly
coarse.”</p>

<p>‘But I am tiring you,’ said Mrs Collingwood,
looking up with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Not at all. I am highly interested. Go on,
please.’</p>

<p>‘We went away to the sea-side, and Charles took
several packets of manuscript with him to amuse
him, as he said, during the long days.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said to me one evening,
“I think one could make something out of these
things. If we cut out the objectionable passages
which I expect were in the way of their publication”——</p>

<p>“My dear Charles,” I said, “these were his
religion, and he would not have touched a word
for worlds to make them more acceptable.”</p>

<p>“And died a martyr to the faith, eh?” said
Charles. “Well, I shan’t be so very particular.
There’s enough for a three-volume novel here,
and I shall expurgate it and try its luck.”</p>

<p>‘Charles was never much of a penman, but I was
a neat quick writer, and thus the copying fell upon
me. Charlie did the botching and patching, and
dictated as I copied. But what a task it was! I am
sure the mere writing of it was worth all we were
destined to get for it, let alone the author’s work
and our amendments. Then we got a lot of the
most taking three-volume novels from the library,
and counted the words and lines, so as to get ours
about the right length. It was finished at last,
just as our house became vacant; and as soon as
we got back to town I took it to a publisher. It
was agreed that I was to do all this part of the
work, for my poor Charlie used to say that if
anything happened to him, I should find the use
of these habits of business.’ Here she paused.</p>

<p>I coughed doubtfully. My knowledge of human
nature led me to attribute the arrangement to shyness
and laziness on his part. I did not, however,
venture to disturb Mrs Collingwood’s illusions.</p>

<p>She resumed: ‘To our surprise and joy, after
a delay of not more than three or four months,
we heard from the publishers accepting our novel.
We did not get any large sum for it, it is true,
but it was highly thought of, and was to be well
advertised; and that was the chief point. Whenever
the author was inquired for, I gave out that
he was my husband, but that he was an invalid.
Charlie really was poorly at the time,’ she said
blushing. ‘Ah, you shake your head; but in
these days, my dear M——, it is necessary to be
<i>rusé</i> as well as clever.’</p>

<p>‘But why not have given it out as the work of
a deceased author?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that would never have done! A publisher
takes a first novel because he hopes for another and
a better. Of what use is it to puff the one golden
egg of a dead goose? No; we were right there—events
have shewn it. Well, our novel was, as
you know, a success. It went off like wild-fire, and
our publishers fed the flame adroitly by issuing
one edition after another—all of the same impression.
All this time we were at work upon another,
which also went down, although not so much
relished as the first. I think we had purified it a
little too much. Avoiding this error in a third, we
again made a hit. Our fortune was now made and
publishers were at our feet. But we were in this
strait: we had come to an end of our finished
works; all that were left now were mere sketches
and outlines, many too vague, and others too
extravagant to be of much use to us. Charles had
good judgment and some critical power, but he had
no creative faculty, neither had I. Happily we did
not deceive ourselves on this point. The question
to be solved was how to supply the want. To
Charles the idea first suggested itself of trying to
secure assistance from outside. It was quite
evident that it would be useless to think of any
person well known in the world of letters. We
set ourselves to study the more obscure literature
of the day.’</p>

<p>I bowed politely, but with some inward mortification.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t think <i>you</i> are in question now,’ said
the lady with an arch smile; ‘wait to the end
of the story. My husband came home one day in a
state of great excitement. He had in his pocket a
copy of the <i>Weekly Dredger</i>, which contained an
instalment of a serial story just commenced.</p>

<p>“Read that,” he cried. When I had finished:
“Now, what do you think?”</p>

<p>‘But I was trembling all over with terror.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he cried.</p>

<p>“O Charles!” I said, “if I did not know it was
impossible, I should say that no one but my late
husband could have written this.”</p>

<p>‘So strongly was I penetrated with this idea,
that for a long time I forbade him to make
any inquiry after the author. At last we were
so pressed to supply another novel that I consented
that he should make inquiries. The story
in the <i>Weekly Dredger</i>, we found, had become
so grotesque and bizarre, that finally the editor
brought it to an abrupt close himself, refusing to
take any more of it; and he made no difficulty
whatever about telling our business agent in confidence
the name of the writer. I must tell you
we had found it necessary to employ an agent,
Mr Smith, who has served us faithfully enough,
but who was never permitted to see my husband.
Well, Charles wrote cautiously to the author of
this queer story, who, it seemed, lived in France;
asking him to send specimens of his stories, and
specifying the quantity required for possible publication,
with his terms. We had in reply a pile of
manuscript. Judge of the relief I felt when I found
that the handwriting was quite unfamiliar to me.
His terms were so low that we had no difficulty in
undertaking to accept all his work. For some
seventy pounds a year we secured everything he
wrote. A great deal of the stuff was utterly useless
to us, but every now and then he gave us the
framework of a powerful story. Well, all of a
sudden he turns sulky and refuses to send any
more. Charlie would have found some one to
supply his place, no doubt. But now I come to the
great misfortune of my life’—with faltering voice—‘the
death of my dear husband.’</p>

<p>‘Your husband dead!’ I cried, quite unprepared
for the announcement.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he is dead; and unhappy me, I have not
been able to mourn his loss except in secret and
with precautions. The funeral even was conducted
with as much caution as if he had been a felon, and
we had been ashamed of having to own that he
had belonged to us. And he was the kindest,
most affectionate——</p>

<p>‘But it was his own wish,’ she went on after a
pause. ‘He planned out everything. You see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>{187}</span>
that although our writings—compilations should
I call them?’ she said with a faint attempt at a
smile—‘brought us in a nice income, yet we were
pleasure-loving people, and had always been accustomed
to plenty of society, and we had saved
nothing out of it. We have two children, a boy
at Rugby, and a daughter at an expensive school;
and there is poor Charlie’s sister, the lady who
accompanies me, and she has no one else to depend
upon but me. Besides, as Charlie urged before he
died: “<i>I</i> am not Collingwood Dawson,” he said;
“why should my death be the cause of his? Keep
him alive, old woman, to be a support to you and
the children and Lizzie.” Those were almost his
last words, dear brave fellow!’ She rose and left
the room, overcome by uncontrollable emotion.</p>

<p>My thoughts, after Mrs Collingwood quitted me,
were rather of a serious turn. I reflected that my
own interests were bound up in the same cause,
and that my own livelihood hung very much upon
keeping up Mr Collingwood Dawson as a going
concern. It was too late to go back now. If I
had gained experience I had lost connection. My
own place had been filled up. Mr Collingwood
Dawson had become as necessary to me as to the
widow and her family. Still the idea of a person
who never died, who enjoyed a sort of corporate
existence, or like the living Buddha, transferred
his identity from one body to another, a being who
could go on writing novels and publishing them till
the crack of doom, struck one with a kind of awe.</p>

<p>As a relief to the troubled current of my
thoughts I took up a newspaper which Mrs
Collingwood had brought with her. It was the
<i>Hebdomadal Review</i>, the number containing the
review of Collingwood Dawson’s last novel. I
turned to the page with a kind of pleased excitement,
for the short abstract that I had seen in
the advertisement, as you have seen, was calculated
to give me the impression that the critique
was an appreciative one. It was so short that I
have no scruple in giving it <i>in extenso</i>: ‘If
it be necessary, and we suppose it is, that silly
ill-educated people should be supplied with the
morbid trash suited to their high capacity, there is
no reason why Mr Collingwood Dawson should not
cater for their wants. We can say of his novel
that it is very good stuff of the kind. The pity is
that there should be so many readers for this kind
of stuff. We only hope that young ladies of the
class who find Mr Dawson’s compilations acceptable,
will not be unduly led away from the paramount
claims of seam and gusset and band by the
enticing interest of his story.’</p>

<p>Satire like this does not hit very hard, however,
and my only feeling after the first disappointment
was of amusement at the ingenuity that had
been able to extract the sting from it and secure
the latent honey. One word, however, seemed
dangerous—‘compilations.’ Was it possible that
the critic had discovered the composite nature of
Mr Collingwood Dawson?</p>


<p class="p2">‘Can you lend me five pounds?’ said a gruff
voice behind me. I turned and saw the squat
figure of M. Houlot close to my chair.</p>

<p>It was an embarrassing question. There was
nothing in M. Houlot’s appearance to invite confidence—at
all events to the extent of five pounds.
At the same time, M. Houlot had in my mind
loomed into considerable importance, for since I
had heard Mrs Collingwood’s story, I had identified
him with the third portion of Mr Collingwood
Dawson.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if it requires consideration, don’t think
about it,’ said Houlot roughly. ‘I won’t trouble
you.’</p>

<p>‘Stop a minute,’ I replied; ‘wait. I don’t know
whether I have the money. I must ask my wife.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you are one of the wretched slaves of a
petticoat, are you?’ said Houlot with a rasping
laugh. ‘I should have thought you had lived
through <i>that</i> stage of your development.’</p>

<p>‘As she will be the principal sufferer if the
money should not be returned, she is entitled to
a voice in the matter.’</p>

<p>‘Look here! If it comes to asking your wife,
I’ll withdraw my request. I know what that
means, well enough. But if you are afraid of not
getting your money back, I’ll give you security.—What
security? Why, manuscripts worth ten,
twenty pounds. I should say, if I were some
people—of priceless value.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ I said to myself, ‘there is Houlot, who has
quarrelled with his bread-and-butter, and now he
comes to me to borrow money to go on with.
Would it not be better to send for Mrs Collingwood,
to see if this is really the man who supplies
her with her plots; and if so, to make the peace
between them, and get him to continue the
supply?’</p>

<p>Mrs Collingwood saved me the trouble of sending
for her. I saw her coming across the garden
to the pavilion. She was composed now and
cheerful; she led one of my girls by the hand,
and was telling her a story, I fancy, in which the
child seemed uncommonly interested.</p>

<p>Houlot was standing leaning against the mantelpiece
with his back to the doorway, and under his
arm his stick, which he was rubbing with the
point of his hook, as was his custom when vexed.
I saw Mrs Collingwood coming in at the doorway—door
and windows were wide open. All of a
sudden her face whitened all over, and she tottered
backwards. I ran to her assistance; but when I
reached the garden, she had already disappeared
within the house.</p>

<p>‘Am I a hobgoblin, that I frighten people?’
said Houlot savagely, coming to the door.
‘Where’s that woman who ran away?’</p>

<p>I made no reply; and he went on rubbing his
stick with the iron hook, apparently in a very
evil temper.</p>

<p>‘I want that money particularly. I want to
go to England and expose this Collingwood
Dawson, to strip him of his borrowed plumes,
and shew the British public what a daw this
fellow is whom they admire. Come; give me this
five pounds, and let me go.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t say anything more to you just now,’
I replied. ‘I will let you know to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘That will lose me two days; I want to start
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help it. I can’t let you have the
money now.’</p>

<p>Houlot saw that I was in some flurry and confusion,
and thought probably that I was afraid
of him, and that by bullying me a little he should
get what he wanted.</p>

<p>‘Come now!’ he cried; ‘go and get me that
money. I know what I know, and I am not to
be stopped for a paltry five-pound note.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>{188}</span></p>

<p>My reply was to shew him the door. He
scowled at me, fingered his stick as if he had
a mind to hit me, thought better of it seemingly,
and went out growling inarticulately.</p>

<p>‘Where is he, that man?’ cried Mrs Collingwood
meeting me in the doorway of the house,
looking quite livid with fear. ‘What do you
know of him? Where does he come from?’</p>

<p>‘He is your correspondent, the author of your
plots.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, then is he my husband!’ she cried in a
voice that, though low and subdued, was full of
anguish. ‘What a wretched being am I, to have
seen him!’</p>

<p>‘It would have been worse still had he seen
you,’ I muttered. ‘Come, Mrs Collingwood—come
into the garden, into the open air; you will be
better there. Take my arm; keep up your heart;
all will be well yet.’</p>

<p>‘Where is he? where is he?’ was all she could
say.</p>

<p>‘He is gone; you are quite safe.’</p>

<p>We began to pace up and down the garden
together, she wringing her hands and writhing
with pain and emotion.</p>

<p>‘Do consider,’ I said, ‘that he has kept out of
the way all these years, and that he is not likely
to trouble you now.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I can’t bear to think. The children—poor
Charlie, what will become of us all?’</p>

<p>‘The children will take no harm,’ I said, ‘if you
act prudently. All will be well; and your late
husband is out of the reach of any trouble.’</p>

<p>‘Ah yes, poor Charlie! I wish I had died with
him. Even now he may be reproaching me!
How dreadful, dreadful it all is!’</p>

<p>I could not give her much consolation; for
besides these troubles of the heart, other and less
manageable difficulties I saw were impending.</p>

<p>At the first blush it was impossible to say what
would become of us all in this imbroglio. Certainly
if any one were entitled to be considered Collingwood
Dawson, it was the man who had originated
the works by which he had obtained his fame.
On the other hand, he would never have had
any success himself. No publisher would have
looked twice at books which were so violent and
coarse. All the labour and pains that had been
taken in bringing his writings into an acceptable
form, were they to go for nothing? And was it to
be allowed that a man who had thrown off all ties
and abandoned his place in the world, should
resume them when other people had made them
worth possessing? It seemed not; and yet the
law would be on his side.</p>

<p>There was only one consoling feature in the
position—the man had no money. He could not
move without that; and if he had been able to
obtain it from any other source, he would hardly
have come to borrow from a stranger; but this
was a very frail barrier after all. He might, if he
were determined to get back to England, find his
way to the nearest port, and get passed home by
the consul as a distressed British subject. Why he
had not gone over to England when he first discovered
the use that had been made of his talents,
was probably because he waited to complete some
work he had in hand, which might serve as an
introduction to the publishers, and a sort of voucher
for his claim.</p>

<p>Was there, however, no possibility of mistake?
Was it perfectly certain that this was the missing
husband? Mrs Collingwood had no hope that
there was any error. She knew him perfectly.
It was impossible that there should be two such
people in the world together, identical in mind and
in person. That his handwriting had so completely
changed, seemed to her unaccountable;
but it did not move her faith in his identity. And
an explanation was soon found for this; for he
had lost his right hand since his flight, and consequently
wrote with his left.</p>

<p>I said just now that I could give Mrs Collingwood
no comfort; but there was one thing that
bound us all together and insured sympathy
between us: we were so to speak all in the same
boat. Our livelihood depended upon keeping up
the integrity of Collingwood Dawson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_MOORLAND_WEDDING">A MOORLAND WEDDING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the month of June last year, when the
days were about their longest, that the scattered
dwellers in the upland parish of L—— were
excited by the intimation of a marriage in one
of their glens. Among a sparse population an
event of this sort necessarily happens but rarely,
and as a consequence when it does happen it
comes attended by much more ‘pomp and circumstance’
than would otherwise accompany it.
As an angel sent by some gracious fate, it stirs
the stagnant pool of existence, and revives hearts
that may have drooped through dreary days of
solitude. The people who have participated
in it are livelier in their talk and wear a blither
aspect for days and weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>A breeze was blowing through the bright June
sunlight, and the shadows of a few clouds were
moving quietly across the hills, when about
three o’clock in the afternoon I set out on foot for
the scene of the marriage that has been referred
to. The point from which I started lay upon
the highest tract of cultivated land at the head
of a prettily wooded valley, and I had to
walk seven miles by mountain-side and glen
before reaching the cottage that was my destination.
For the first portion of the way there is an
excellent cart-road—excellent for a hill-country
whose pastoral-bred pedestrians do not greatly
need roads; but after some three miles have been
got over the traveller finds himself almost literally
at large among the mountains, with but a
feeble indication of a foot-track along the brow
of a deep ravine, and a mountain stream below.</p>

<p>Continuing my course, the glen began to expand
again, and its slopes to lose their covering of
brushwood. A strip of level verdure, broadening
as I ascended, stretched on each side of the
water; and after following several windings of the
stream without any change in the character of its
banks, the moorland cottage that I was in search
of lay before me.</p>

<p>The first thing I observed was an animated
crowd of people streaming out of the door two and
two, and setting off for an elevation that stood
some distance to the right. On arriving at the
cottage I learned that these were the bride’s people
gone to meet the party of the bridegroom, and to
take part in ‘running the broose,’ which is a
foot-race among the young lads for the bride’s-maid’s
handkerchief. Herself the goal, the bride’s-maid,
fluttering in white and scarlet, had ascended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>{189}</span>
to a knoll before the cottage, and some time afterwards
held up a silk handkerchief to the eyes of
the expectant runners.</p>

<p>I fancy there are few spectacles that produce
in one’s mind a stronger sense of savage freedom
than that of civilised human beings let loose,
coatless, vestless, bonnetless, to race among the
hills. In less than two minutes from their starting
on the homeward race they had sunk out of
view at the foot of the highest hill, and when
they hailed in sight again, they were much more
widely scattered than at the beginning. Two or
three in the rear had already dropped out of the
race; but those in the front seemed to be still
running with energy and determination. Once or
twice again we lost them in the hollows, and each
time they reappeared we could notice that their
number was gradually getting smaller; so that by
the time the leader swept across the stream in
front of us, all other competitors had given up
the contest as hopeless. A cheer broke forth as
he struggled up the knoll panting and bemired to
clutch the coveted prize, which, with similar ones
thus gained, I find it is a great ambition among
the young men in some districts to accumulate.
The winner of the ‘broose’ was a tall and finely
formed youth of fair complexion; with clear blue
eyes and well-cut features.</p>

<p>As soon as the stragglers had come forward,
followed by the bridegroom and his man, amid
tremendous cheering, the marriage ceremony was
proceeded with in the kitchen. It was a long low-roofed
apartment, with innumerable shoulders of
mutton in all the stages towards ham, depending
from the rafters. The bride was led out of an
anteroom, resting on her father’s arm. He was a
rather oldish man, with the history of a good many
troubles plainly written upon his face. The bride
was a broad-shouldered, brown-visaged, and gray-eyed
maiden of about four-and-twenty; and her
future husband, a loose-limbed, amiable-looking
youth in a lavender necktie and fiery red hair,
looked possibly a year or two younger. The
service was performed by a Presbyterian clergyman,
and was accordingly a short one. Immediately
it was over there was a multitudinous
shaking of hands with the happy couple. It was
interesting to note the various phraseologies in
which the numerous guests severally expressed
their good wishes; all the degrees of feelings from
that of ordinary regard to the most ebullient
affection, being apparently represented.</p>

<p>While this process was going forward, the mother
of the bride, a sallow-faced person with kindly
black eyes, and gray hair smoothed neatly across
her brow, took up a position by the fire to advance
arrangements for the tea. You could see that the
good woman was greatly excited and confused.
Probably she had never had so many people under
her humble roof before; and there were ‘grand
folk’ among them too, the surrounding farmers
and their families, for whose (comparatively)
delicate palates she was quite unaccustomed to
prepare food. Every now and then while proceeding
with her duties, she would catch up the corner
of her ample white apron, and wiping the perspiration
from her forehead, would draw a long sigh,
as of sadness or fatigue. The movements of the
company around her seemed to attract her but
little; all the evening she wore a preoccupied
expression, and it was evident that she had within
her mind a picture of her own, on which her
thoughts were dwelling. But what the scene was
that was calling her away from the merriment of
the hour I possessed no means of ascertaining;
and the reader is at liberty to fill up this blank
in the narrative as best delights his fancy.</p>



<p class="p2">A portion of the company now seated itself at
a heavily laden tea-table that was laid out in
an adjoining chamber; and here let me remark
that as Scottish weddings are celebrated in the
afternoon or evening, the entertainment known by
the English as the déjeûner, is unknown to their
northern neighbours. But there are few such teas
served in cities or even in Lowland dwellings as
had been that night prepared for us. The result
of a good week’s labour of several women in carrying,
boiling, and baking, seemed to be placed upon
the board. Let the reader remember that it was
in Scotland that this wedding took place, and he
will appreciate the bill of fare the better. It was
by no means a much varied one, but the several
articles had been provided in unlimited supply.
Fresh baked scones lined each side of the table in
castellated rows; platefuls of dark-coloured ‘braxy’
ham, cut from the mutton that hung on the rafters,
stood in between them, with here and there a
pile of thick cut, deeply buttered bread. There
were also buns, ‘cookies,’ biscuits, and gimcracks,
that must have been carried painfully over miles of
moorland; and raised majestically at the head of
the table was a little white bride-cake surmounted
by a solitary flag.</p>

<p>When the company had crushed themselves
into seats around the table, and were just going
to operate upon the braxy, a big-boned, bleached-looking
old man was furtively led on to the end
of a bench that had been placed near the door.
I soon discovered that, after the minister, this was
for the time being the most important of the
invited assembly. He was in fact no less a personage
than the fiddler, and was, as he ought to
have been, in keeping with the character of the
traditionary musician, almost stone-blind. This
Demodocus had been led hither from his dwelling
five miles over the hills by a little boy, his grandson,
who had fair hair, and wore faded velvet and
corduroys. The heartiness with which the veteran
musician laid in a store of victual against the
labour of a long night’s fiddling, was a most refreshing
sight. He was a long-faced, heavy-jawed
man, and had rusty gray hair that fell unkempt
upon a much worn velvet collar. A large scarlet
cotton handkerchief was twisted carelessly about
his neck, and came down in a loose fold upon his
breast. He wore an aspect of silent passive misfortune;
and as you looked at him it was difficult
to imagine music dwelling in his soul, how much
soever it might dwell in his fiddle.</p>

<p>As soon as the tea was ended, or rather this first
instalment of it, he was guided to an elevated seat
that had been prepared for him in a corner of the
kitchen, where he began scraping and preluding
with his fiddle. To many of the lads and lasses
this was the first intimation of the musician’s
presence; and it was the signal for a little preliminary
coquetry with the eyes, while it lit up
their honest faces with blushes and expectant
smiles.</p>

<p>A Scottish wedding without a dance is next door
to no wedding at all, so little time was lost in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>{190}</span>
stepping to the floor. There were Scotch reels,
country-dances, and polkas, and now and then a
quadrille was decorously walked through by the
two or three young farmers and their sweethearts.
But unquestionably the Scotch reel was the
favourite, and maintained the precedence throughout
the whole of the entertainment. As most
readers doubtless know, this is a lively and
stirring dance, that permits a good deal of jumping
and stamping, and is admirably adapted to the
social requirements of a warm-hearted and excitable
people. Whether its popularity in Scotland has
anything to do with the Celtic origin of the inhabitants,
I do not take upon me to suggest; but
certain it is, that after seeing it performed, as on
the present occasion, with all the vivacity that
belongs to it, you would not think of associating
it with a grave and solemn-minded race. To the
uninitiated onlooker it is nothing but an indistinguishable
confusion; in which he may observe
that there is a great deal of bobbing with the
head and shuffling with the feet, and that it is
in nowise adapted to a staid person of fashion.
Nevertheless it stood in high favour on the present
occasion, and seemed to please abundantly
the agile young persons who performed in it.
What matter to them though it should be unfashionable!
They had come to this wedding to
enjoy themselves; and much as the horrid crew in
‘Alloway’s auld haunted kirk’ despised foreign
cotillons, so did these children of hills and valleys
stick to their native reels and country-dances.</p>

<p>After a time, when the music had begun to
work in his soul, and he had been set athinking
upon ‘the brave days of old,’ you would notice
a reverend senior bravely leading out some gay
and handsome maiden, and challenging another
gray-headed veteran to face him in the dance.
These exhibitions of pluck and spirit in the
fathers uniformly evoked hearty plaudits from
the company; and some one would call out to
‘Archie’ the fiddler, ‘to put his best foot foremost
this time.’ Archie had by this time got
worked into a state of considerable energy and
enthusiasm, and was in some respects quite a different
character from that of two hours ago at the
tea-table. The colour had travelled back to his
old withered cheek, and his features looked a deal
more soft and flexible; his face and form seemed
much more indicative of life; youth seemed to
be coming back to him at the call of his own
fiddle. It was interesting to observe as he became
enthusiastic in his fiddling, how sympathetic was
his every motion. How his rickety old legs
crossed and bobbed up and down; the body in a
tremble, and constant movement in the shoulders;
while the head was perpetual motion, now hanging
down upon his breast, now erect and turning
on its socket, now thrown backwards, and such
eyes as were in it—poor ‘ruined orbs’—directed
restlessly towards the ceiling. Archie’s <i>tout ensemble</i>
was a visible embodiment of the doctrine
that music incites to motion.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Music has charms to <i>stir</i> the savage breast</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>no less than to ‘soothe’ it. Now and then the
dancers would cease a while, and seated in benches
round the room, would listen in silence to a song.
A broad-faced, dull-eyed, young shepherd, with
more energy than finish, sang <i>My Hielan’ Hills</i>,
and a dark pawky little man recited out of a
corner very slyly, <i>Rabbin Tamson’s Smiddy</i>. <i>The
Laird o’ Cockpen</i>, <i>Why Left I my Hame?</i> and <i>Willie
brewed a Peck o’ Maut</i>, were also given; the last
named being received with great enthusiasm.
There was little culpable indulgence in whisky that
I observed. This may have been owing to the
judicious arrangements of the host for refreshing
his guests during the evening with the national
‘toddy’ instead of the more potent undiluted spirit.
Several times a tray was handed round, bearing
piles of bread-and-cheese, and a large jug full
of the resuscitating beverage; and though the
latter in some cases was a little freely partaken
of, there was no unseemly manifestation of its
effects.</p>

<p>And thus, through the warm hours of that
summer’s night, with lonely hills listening in their
dreams, the wedding festival of the shepherd’s
daughter glided merrily along. The sun had been
already near two hours climbing up the east, and
the pale morning light had once more shot its rays
into many a glen and hollow, when these mountain
merry-makers ceased their saturnalia. The evening
before, they had assembled for the feast trim,
fresh, rosy, and buoyant; and when the ‘garish
day’ sent his mocking light through the narrow
window-panes and shone upon the forms of the
dancers, they looked rosy and buoyant still. The
smoothness had departed from their hair and the
aspect of freshness from their garments; frills and
ribbons had been dragged awry; but the colour
was as fresh in their cheeks, and their eyes were
quite as lustrous as when eight hours before they
had stamped and bobbed and ‘<i>hooch’d</i>’ through
their first Scotch reel. The most of them would
tramp their half-dozen miles and more back over
the hills, and go through the usual labours of
the day with hardly a symptom of fatigue.</p>

<p>When all had come out of the cottage, and
immediately before the separation, about three-fourths
of the party congregating on the little knoll
before the door where the bride’s-maid had stood
with the handkerchief on the previous evening,
sent forth a long-drawn, far-reverberating cheer.
Then followed a tumultuous shaking of hands,
with many a kindly spoken farewell; and then
finally they departed, each group on its own path,
for their wide-scattered farms and cottages. Some
days would pass during which the memory of the
wedding would be continually in their thoughts,
forming a mental picture that gave them solace in
the midst of outward dreariness. But gradually
the lines of the picture would lose their vividness,
and it would be less frequently recurred to by
the fancy, less fervently yearned after by the
heart. Emotions that had been stirred by that
night’s entertainment would after a while subside
again; the old duties would present themselves
anew, calling for the old labour and attention;
and harmony would be again established between
the inward life and the outward circumstances.</p>

<p>The newly married couple had arranged to stay
at the cottage till the afternoon, and then to set
out for their future home, which lay in the adjoining
parish, and about ten miles away. That
parish in its whole extent was high-lying and pastoral;
and therefore the dwelling to which they
were going would be in every way as lonely as
the one from which they were departing. From
what I had noticed of the bride’s mother, she
would undoubtedly feel melancholy over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>{191}</span>
losing of her daughter, the last that had remained
with her out of five; and I can think of her that
afternoon, when the two young people had left
her, slipping out to the door, and having shaded
her eyes with her hand, taking a far look at them
as they passed out of her sight among the hills.
Then she would walk pensively back into her now
dull-looking kitchen, and perhaps ponder with
some sadness about becoming old. The bride and
bridegroom would arrive at their abode in the
gray hours of the evening, where some relative
would be waiting to receive them. It would be
such another cottage as the one we have been
visiting; and there, in the wide wilderness, untamed
nature on every side of them, they would
settle down to await the domesticities that fate
might send.</p>

<p>Is there not something almost awe-striking in
the thought of civilised human beings settling
down to face perhaps half a century of life in
solitudes like these, all unconscious of the mighty
pulse-beats of the world they dwell in? It is to be
presumed that this red-haired Briton who has just
led home his bride across ten miles of moorland,
possesses a fair share of practical energy and some
fragments of intellect; he has the faculty of loving
his fellow-men and of gaining happiness, perhaps
also wisdom, from hours of bright social intercourse.
If he were now planted amid stimulating circumstances,
a fine moral nature might possibly be developed
by the time his years were through. But
immured in this mountain fastness, away from
human din, his mind will probably never be
unfolded to the least self-conscious effort; and he
will leave life at seventy little advanced in intellectual
attainment on what he was at twenty-five.
For although Nature is an open book, teeming
over with wise and great lessons, it is only after
toiling through initiatory stages of culture that
we can intelligently read her book, or even believe
that it exists. The unlettered shepherd nestling
in her shaggy bosom, unless she has gifted him
with genius, rarely dreams of the truths that she
is symbolically publishing around him. And I
think of the future life of him whose marriage
we have been celebrating as something far different
from that of a home-bred philosopher or poet.
Performing his simple pastoral duties with honesty
of purpose, I can still imagine his life to be
monotonous, irksome, and stagnant; having in
it many hours of idleness unillumined by neighbourly
greetings or the mystic gleams of intelligent
research. As he goes his rounds in summer-time,
he will see the wide stillness of morning
upon the hills; in winter he will have to
battle with the fury of the storm. The gloaming
will find him cultivating an unfruitful garden,
or gathering hay out of morasses for his cow,
or sitting over his peat-fire knitting homespun
stockings or reading legends of the Covenanters.
Now and then a distant neighbour, leading a life as
lonely as himself, or some wandering angler, will
drop in upon him, and be treated to a hospitable
meal. But he will hardly see another face the
whole year through, except perchance on Sunday—until
the ‘clipping’ season comes round, when
he will be called away, now in one direction now
in another, to days of social labour.</p>

<p>Some day, let us hope, a wee body will appear
upon his hearth—his own offspring, to be loved,
nourished, and instructed; and then probably there
will come another and another till a considerable
family is grouped around him. The care and training
of these children will be a kind of education
to himself. The nursing of them will not fail
to develop the womanliness of the wife. Let us
hope that she may have much of a mother’s happiness
and little of a mother’s sorrow, and that rosy
health will be ever upon her hearth! May her
boys grow up broad-shouldered and manly; may
her girls be handsome, modest, and fair; and some
day or other, a quarter of a century hence, may
there be another moorland wedding, when those
of us who have assisted at the present one, fiddler
and dancers, writer and readers, shall be wearing
away or perhaps gathered to ‘the land o’ the leal.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EGG-CULTURE">EGG-CULTURE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> do we import seven or eight hundred million
eggs every year, and pay two millions and a half
sterling for them? The answer is, that the
demand for eggs is steadily increasing, while the
home produce is either lessening or stationary in
amount.</p>

<p>Why the home supply does not advance with
the increase of demand, is a question that calls for
a little attention to the commercial aspects of
farming. So many small holdings have been
absorbed by large farms, that many a cottage
housewife has been withdrawn from rural life who
would otherwise have reared cottage poultry;
neither the allotment-holder nor the artisan has
range and space enough for rearing eggs to
advantage.</p>

<p>In a trade journal called <i>The Grocer</i>, in which
much information concerning the provision trades
is given, the following remarks occur: ‘If a due
attention to details were given in this country, the
stock of fowls which roam about the farmyard and
gather corn from the thrashing, instead of being a
mere adjunct and perquisite of the servants, would
return sufficient to discharge the rental of many a
small holding. Such, we have understood, has
been the case where the experiment has been fairly
tried; and once this becomes an established
notion, our own supplies will increase in a greater
ratio than they do at present. According to a
competent authority, at this time—what with
improved native and imported varieties—we
possess the best stock of egg-layers in the world.
In no country is the management of our best
poultry-yards excelled. These should serve as a
model for the rest; to bring up the wholesale
results to their true national importance, all we
require is an extension of the taste for poultry-farming
amongst those who earn their living on
the land.’</p>

<p>The real new-laid eggs of home produce are
comparatively few. Their excellence is best
appreciated by obtaining them at country farmhouses.
The small farmers who do not take nor
send their eggs to open market sell them to
country shopkeepers, or barter them for other
commodities. Many cottagers contrive to keep a
few fowls; and where there is no pig, these fowls
act as scavengers, consuming the scraps of the
family, the outside cabbage-leaves, peelings of
boiled potatoes, &amp;c.; if the fowls are supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>{192}</span>
with a little corn, they will lay a good many eggs.
This desultory mode of leaving poultry to find
their food as best they may is, however, quite a
mistake, and can never be adequately remunerative.
Fowls, to pay, must be well looked after,
and systematically fed and housed.</p>

<p>Ireland used to supply England with a considerable
number of eggs, and perhaps may continue so
to do; but statistical details of the trade between
the two portions of the United Kingdom are not
now published. About thirty years ago, fifty
million eggs were annually shipped from Dublin
alone to London and Liverpool, value about a
hundred and twenty thousand pounds; the supply
obtained from all Ireland very much exceeded this
amount. Mr Weld, in his description of Roscommon
about that period, noticed some of the
features of the egg-trade in the rural districts of
Ireland: ‘The eggs are collected from the cottages
for several miles round by runners, boys nine
years old and upwards, each of whom has a regular
beat which he goes over daily, bearing back the
produce of his toil carefully stored in a small
hand-basket. I have frequently met with these
boys on their rounds; and the caution necessary
for bringing their brittle ware with safety seemed
to have communicated an air of business and
steadiness to their manner unusual to the ordinary
volatile habits of children in Ireland.’</p>

<p>But as we have said, a large supply from abroad
has become a necessity; and the characteristics of
this supply are worth knowing; because they
shew that the trade can be conducted profitably
without having recourse to artificial incubation or
hatching—a system which has at times had many
advocates in England.</p>

<p>The importation of French eggs into this country
has increased in an almost incredible degree,
owing in part to the facilities afforded by the
commercial treaty between England and France.
It has risen from about a hundred and fifty
million to six or seven hundred million eggs
annually, since the year 1860; while the value
per thousand has also increased, until at length
our importers pay at least two millions and a half
sterling for the yearly import. The eggs are
brought over chiefly in steamers, and landed at
Southampton, Folkestone, Arundel, Newhaven,
and Shoreham.</p>

<p>The egg-culture in France is almost exclusively
confined to small farmers, who carry it on in a
vigorous and commercial spirit, chiefly in Burgundy,
Normandy, and Picardy. Every village
has its weekly market, to which farmers and their
wives bring their produce, in preference to selling
at the farmyard to itinerant dealers. A merchant
will sometimes buy twenty thousand eggs at one
market; he takes them to his warehouse, where
they are sorted and packed, and possibly sent off
the same day to Paris or to London. According
to the conditions required by the buyers, the eggs
are sometimes counted, sometimes ‘sized’ by passing
them through a ring, sometimes bought in
bulk. In many of the north-west districts of
France, poultry villages send almost their whole
supply of eggs to England, from Calais, Cherbourg,
and Honfleur, packed in cases containing from six
hundred to twelve hundred each. Nearly all
continental countries producing sufficient eggs for
their own supply, the export from France is almost
entirely to England. It is found that the buckwheat
districts are those in which most eggs are
reared—possibly a useful hint to English rearers.</p>

<p>The production of eggs for market is one thing,
and the hatching of them another. We do not
here go into the question of hatching, though
much that is interesting could be written on the
subject. It is enough to say that all the ingenious
plans that have been set on foot for the artificial
hatching and rearing of poultry have broken down
through the costliness of the arrangements and
management. Those who have tried any of these
plans have arrived at the conclusion that both eggs
and poultry can only be produced on a cheap scale
by farmers or cottagers. And this opinion stands
to reason. About farmyards and cottages in rural
districts, hens can pick up food that would otherwise
be wasted. Besides, let it be kept in mind,
that hens like to roam about scratching for seeds,
worms, and particles of lime to furnish material
out of which the shells of their eggs are formed.
If kept in confinement, exceeding care is required
to supply the creatures with such requisites
as their maternal instincts seem to require.
What we suggest is, that cottagers, farmers, and
others possessing sufficient scope for keeping
poultry, should go far more largely into the
business of egg-culture than they do at present.
Why should they allow the great egg-supply for
this country to be in the hands of others?
The answer, we fear, is, that our farming classes
generally look down contemptuously on the supplying
of eggs for market. It is too small an affair
to invite consideration. Small! Two millions and
a half of money annually carried off by the
French. Is that a trade to be treated with indifference?</p>

<p>We hear much of women’s work, and of how
young ladies should employ themselves. Here
is something, at all events, for farmers’ wives
and daughters to set their face to without the
slightest derogation of rank or character. Let
them take up in real earnest the culture of fowls,
if only for the sake of the eggs which on a
great and remunerative scale may be produced.
Those farmers’ wives who already appropriate
part of their leisure to this occupation deserve all
honour; and we honour them accordingly.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
